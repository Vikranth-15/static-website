            <p class="description">The Taj Mahal is a magnificent white marble monument located in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal and is considered a symbol of eternal love. Construction began in 1632 and took about 21 years to complete, involving thousands of artisans and craftsmen. The Taj Mahal is an excellent example of Mughal architecture, combining elements of Islamic, Persian, and Indian styles. Its large central dome, four graceful minarets, beautiful gardens, and intricate marble inlay work make it one of the most admired structures in the world. Recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Taj Mahal is also one of the Seven Wonders of the World and attracts millions of visitors every year.</p>
