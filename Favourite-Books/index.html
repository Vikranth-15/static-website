                <p class="fav-books-card-para">The Bhagavad Gita, often called the Song of God, is one of the most revered texts in Hindu philosophy. It forms part of the Indian epic Mahabharata and is presented as a dialogue between Prince Arjuna and Lord Krishna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. Faced with a moral and emotional crisis about fighting in the war against his own relatives, Arjuna turns to Krishna, who serves as his charioteer and divine guide.
                    Across 18 chapters and 700 verses, Krishna imparts timeless wisdom on duty (dharma), righteousness, devotion (bhakti), selfless action (karma yoga), meditation (dhyana yoga), and the pursuit of spiritual liberation (moksha).

                <h1 class="fav-books-card-heading">Atomic Habits</h1>
                <p class="fav-books-card-para">he book Atomic Habits by James Clear is a practical guide to understanding how small, consistent changes can lead to remarkable long-term results. It emphasizes that habits are the compound interest of self-improvement—tiny actions, repeated daily, shape identity and outcomes over time. Clear introduces the Four Laws of Behavior Change: make habits obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying. By applying these principles, individuals can build good habits and break bad ones effectively. A central theme of the book is identity-based habits, where lasting transformation comes not from chasing goals but from redefining oneself (“I am a healthy person” rather than “I want to lose weight”). The book also stresses the importance of focusing on systems rather than outcomes, showing that success is the result of consistent processes rather than one-time efforts. With its blend of psychology, neuroscience, and practical strategies, Atomic Habits has become a widely influential manual for personal growth, productivity, and behavior change.

                <p class="fav-books-card-para">The Power of the Subconscious Mind, popularized by Joseph Murphy, explores how our subconscious shapes thoughts, behaviors, and life outcomes. Murphy argues that the subconscious is a vast reservoir of inner power, influencing intuition, healing, creativity, and even the conditions we attract into our lives. He emphasizes that faith and belief play a central role—miraculous healings and transformations often occur not because of external forces, but because the subconscious mind responds to deep conviction. By consciously programming the subconscious with positive thoughts, affirmations, and visualization, individuals can overcome fear, achieve success, and improve health, wealth, and relationships.

                <p class="fav-books-card-para">The art of being alone is about embracing solitude as a source of strength, clarity, and self-discovery rather than seeing it as loneliness. When practiced intentionally, solitude allows you to reconnect with yourself, reflect deeply, and cultivate inner peace. It teaches independence, resilience, and the ability to enjoy your own company without relying on external validation. Many philosophers, writers, and spiritual traditions highlight solitude as essential for creativity, mindfulness, and personal growth. By spending time alone—whether through meditation, journaling, walking in nature, or simply sitting quietly—you create space to listen to your inner voice, process emotions, and develop self-awareness. Far from isolation, the art of being alone is about building a healthy relationship with yourself, which in turn strengthens your connections with others.
